                        <p>
                           First, I would like to greet you a Happy Hearts Day! 
                           Second, Even though may misunderstanding tayo kagabi but I hope na you've forgiven me na po. I'm so sorry po gabie baby.
                           Third, I'm so grateful and blessed to have you baby, though sometimes nga we do have some misunderstandings but it doesn't change the fact that I trully love and treasure you deeply My Queen. I wanna pray and see you na you'll be achieving your dreams with or without me in any costs, I prayed that always to God my baby. I just wanted na you wont be facing any hardship in the near future kay you trully doesnt deserve any of it. You're so very unique and different among your peers which made me fall deeply inloved with you. You're cool, matalino, God fearing, VERY UNDERSTANDING, you smell nice, you're so very cute, you look so damn gorgeous even in the simplest fit you can wear, you don't have any vices, and many more. Which made me question myself sometimes if I'm qualified or befitting to have you as my partner, but aside from all of that. I AM TRULLY BLESSED BY GOD TO HAVE SUCH A GREAT, AMAZING, GORGEOUS PARTNER. BABY I WANNA THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME UNCONDITIONALLY, I know nga its too early pa to say such things but nevertheless I wanna let you know how much I value po. I'll just continue and strive pa more to be more befitting for you baby.Sorry po baby if this is all I can do for now since I don't have funds pa to buy you some flowers, but bawi nalang ako puhon baby. Once again THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE LOVE, till the very last breath this physically body of mine up until we meet in heaven, I LOVE YOU SO VERY MUCH MY BABY, MY QUEEN, MY WIFE. MWAPS. Happy Hearts Day!
